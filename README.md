# Debugging

* If your cluster is locked down and you do not have sufficient rights to be able perform services like list Pods you will

 (Forbidden): User "system:serviceaccount:somenamespace:default" cannot list pods in the namespace "somenamespace".

 You need to make sure either the default service acccount in the namespace in which Jenkins is running has enough rights to administer the whole cluster `--clusterrole cluster-admin` or has sufficient rights to perform the operations you are looking to perform. For more information please
